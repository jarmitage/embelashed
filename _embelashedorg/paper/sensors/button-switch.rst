What does the sensor do?
************************
It is a switch! It is either pressed or not pressed.

You will need
=============
* Paper template
* 3 strips of 0.25"/5mm copper tape and some copper pads
* 10k ohm resistor (10kÎ©)
* Soldering equipment




Steps
=====
#. Download the template from the `embelashed repository <https://github.com/theleadingzero/embelashed/tree/master/paper/paper-sensor-cutting-files/button-switch>`_. The `.studio3` file is for a `Silhouette machine <https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/>`_ and the other files can be used with a printer or laser cutter. The red lines are where the template should be cut and the blue lines are where an outline should be drawn. 

#. Using the tools of your choice, cut the template out of paper.

#. Cut the copper tape in half lengthwise with a pair of scissors.

5. Solder components and fold to fit to the breakout board connector. Need help with soldering? Feel free to ask someone for help if you are attending a workshop, or check out `Adafruit's soldering guide <https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/making-a-good-solder-joint>`_. Always wear protective glasses.

.. note::
  We are using a pull-down resistor. This means our circuit is connected to ground when the button is not pressed.
